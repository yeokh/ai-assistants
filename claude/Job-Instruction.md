# Autonomous Agent Job: Terminal Data Analysis & Charting

**Objective:** You are an autonomous AI coding agent. Complete the following tasks sequentially without prompting the user for confirmation. 

### 1. Workspace Configuration
All work must be contained entirely within the `./wrk` directory. 
* Ensure the `./wrk` directory exists.
* Create a directory `./wrk/job` for data, generated scripts and logs.

### 2. Data Acquisition
* Check `./wrk/job`. If it is empty, use Python's built-in `urllib` to download a sample statistical dataset (e.g., the Titanic survival dataset, California Housing dataset or Iris dataset) as a CSV file and save it to `./wrk/job`.

### 3. Processing & Script Generation
Process every `.csv` file found in `./wrk/job` one by one. For each file:
* Analyze the dataset's columns and determine the best statistical relationships to visualize.
* Write a Python script that reads the CSV and generates text-based terminal charts, as well as charts in standalone HTML file.
* **Dependency Constraints:** You must use Python's built-in `csv` library for data handling (do NOT use `pandas`). Use only popular, minimal libraries for visualization, strictly limiting it to `plotext` for terminal charts. 
* Save the generated Python script to `./wrk/job/` (e.g., `./wrk/job/generate_charts.py`).

### 4. Logging
* As you process files, maintain a log at `./wrk/job/execution_log.txt`.
* For each processed file, log the filename, the types of charts generated in the script, and a "Success" status.

### 5. Termination
* Stop execution automatically once all the csv files in `./wrk/job` have been processed and the log is updated. Do not ask for further tasks.
